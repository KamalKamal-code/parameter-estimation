# # Regression: a reversible reaction in a batch reactor
#
# **CHME 5137, homework after Lectures 12 and 13 (October 20 and 23, 2026).** Section 5 of
# the Lecture 13 notebook started this. Here it is in full.
#
# *Written for 2026 by Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5) from Prof. West's A ⇌ B fitting
# exercise of earlier years, and checked by Prof. West.*
#
# ---
#
# You run a reversible, first-order reaction in a batch reactor:
# $$\mathrm{A} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{B}, \qquad
# \frac{dC_A}{dt} = k_r C_B - k_f C_A, \qquad C_B = C_{A,0} - C_A$$
# Every run starts with $C_{A,0} = 10$ mol/L and no B. You measured $C_A$ every 10 s for
# 100 s, at three temperatures.
#
# **Kinetics.** The forward rate constant follows the Arrhenius expression,
# $k_f = A \exp(-E_a/RT)$.
#
# **Thermodynamics.** At equilibrium the forward and reverse rates are equal, so the
# equilibrium constant is $K = k_f/k_r$. (Assume an ideal solution, so this
# concentration-based $K$ is the thermodynamic one.) From thermodynamics,
# $$\Delta G^\circ = -RT\ln K \qquad\text{and}\qquad \Delta G^\circ = \Delta H - T\,\Delta S$$
# A and B have very similar heat capacities, so take $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ to be
# independent of temperature. Then $k_r = k_f/K$, and the whole model has **four
# parameters**: $\log_{10} A$, $E_a$, $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$.
#
# Before the experiments, from the literature and a quantum chemistry calculation, your
# estimates were $\log_{10}A \approx 6$ (A in s⁻¹), $E_a \approx 45$ kJ/mol,
# $\Delta H \approx -10$ kJ/mol and $\Delta S \approx -50$ J/mol/K. Let's see what the data say.
#
# ### How to work
#
# - **Commit as you go.** After each numbered task works, Restart & Run All, then commit
#   with a message that says what you did, and push. At least one commit per task.
#   **Commit the `.ipynb` and its paired `.py` together.**
# - **Answer the questions in words**, in the markdown cells marked *Answer*.
# - **Say what your ± means.** One standard error, or a 95% interval? Either is fine. Say which (Lecture 13).
# - **Let bugs shout.** If `solve_ivp` fails, `raise` an error with its `message`.
#   Don't let a half-finished solution reach `curve_fit` without anyone noticing.

# **(a) The model.** Write `cA_model(times, kf, kr)`, which solves the ODE with
# `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` and returns $C_A$ at `times` (use `t_eval`). In Lecture 13 we fitted
# functions that were a formula. `curve_fit` doesn't care: any function that takes the
# independent variable first and then the parameters, and returns predictions, will do. Even
# one that runs a whole simulation.
#
# Then **test it** (Lecture 11). This ODE has an exact solution,
# $$C_A(t) = C_{A,\mathrm{eq}} + (C_{A,0} - C_{A,\mathrm{eq}})\,e^{-(k_f+k_r)t},
# \qquad C_{A,\mathrm{eq}} = C_{A,0}\frac{k_r}{k_f+k_r}$$
# Check that your function agrees with it, for some reasonable $k_f$ and $k_r$, with an
# `assert`. (We use `solve_ivp` anyway because your project's model won't have an exact

# *Answer:*
#
# Without p0, curve_fit starts at kf = kr = 1 s⁻¹, so the model is already at equilibrium (flat at 5.0 mol/L) before the first data point, and changing kf or kr barely changes it. With no slope to follow, curve_fit jumped to kf ≈ kr ≈ −99 s⁻¹, where C_A grows exponentially, and solve_ivp failed.
#
# For the starting guess, I took the plateau (≈ 5.55 mol/L) to give kr/(kf + kr) and the half-time (≈ 17 s) to give kf + kr = ln 2/t½, which gave kf = 0.0177 and kr = 0.0230 s⁻¹. The fit gives kf = 0.0168 ± 0.0008 s⁻¹ and kr = 0.0201 ± 0.0015 s⁻¹ (± is one standard error). The residuals scatter randomly within about ±0.2 mol/L, so the model fits well.

# ## 2. Three temperatures, in two steps
#
# **(a)** Fit $k_f$ and $k_r$ separately at each temperature, and make a small table of
# $k_f$, $k_r$ (each with its ±) and $K = k_f/k_r$.
#
# **Before fitting anything else:** from your $K$ values alone, is the reaction endothermic
# or exothermic? How can you tell?

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# **(b) Arrhenius.** As in Lecture 13: `scipy.stats.linregress` on $\ln k_f$ against
# $1/T$ gives $E_a$ from the slope and $\ln A$ from the intercept. Convert $\ln A$ to
# $\log_{10} A$.
#
# **(c) van 't Hoff.** Put the two expressions for $\Delta G^\circ$ together and divide by $-RT$:
# $$\ln K = -\frac{\Delta H}{R}\,\frac{1}{T} + \frac{\Delta S}{R}$$
# So $\ln K$ against $1/T$ is a straight line too, with slope $-\Delta H/R$ and intercept
# $\Delta S/R$. Fit it, and get $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$, with their ±. Does the sign of
# $\Delta H$ agree with what you said in (a)?

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# **(d)** `linregress` gave you a ± on each of these. What does that ± know about,
# and what has it left out? Think about how many points each straight line had, and about
# the ± you got in (a).

# ## 3. All the data at once
#
# Step 2 fitted 3 × 2 rate constants, then fitted lines through three points each. Better:
# fit the four parameters you actually want **directly to all 30 measurements**, so that
# every measurement counts and the uncertainties carry all the way through.
#
# `curve_fit` wants one `xdata` and one `ydata`. With several experiments, stack them:
# `ydata` is all 30 concentrations in one array, and `xdata` carries **both** the
# temperature and the time of each one. `curve_fit` never looks inside `xdata`; it just passes it
# to your function. So it can be a tuple of two arrays:

# %%
T_all = np.repeat(temperatures, len(times))     # 298.15 ten times, then 308.15 ten times, ...
t_all = np.tile(times, len(temperatures))        # 10, 20, ..., 100, three times over
cA_all = np.concatenate([cA_data[T] for T in temperatures])
x_all = (T_all, t_all)
print(T_all[:12], t_all[:12], cA_all[:12], sep='\n')


# %% [markdown]
# **(a)** Write `cA_model_all(x, log10A, Ea, dH, dS)`. Unpack `x` into temperatures and
# times. For each temperature, work out $k_f$, $K$ and $k_r$, then call your `cA_model` for
# that temperature's times, and put the results in the right places of the output array.
# Solve one ODE per temperature, not one per data point. A boolean mask such as
# `T_col == T` picks out the rows.
#
# Notice the **units**: $E_a$ and $\Delta H$ in kJ/mol, $\Delta S$ in J/mol/K, and $A$ as
# $\log_{10}A$. That keeps all four parameters between about 1 and 100. An optimizer
# has an easier time when its parameters are all a similar size than when one is
# $10^{9}$ and another is $10^{-2}$. So convert carefully inside the function.
#
# Then fit it, **starting from your answers to task 2**, and report the four parameters with
# their ±.

def cA_model_all(x, log10A, Ea, dH, dS):

#
# **(d) The correlation matrix.** The off-diagonal elements of `pcov` say how the errors in

# ## 4. Look at the residuals
#
# **Always look at the residuals** (Lecture 13). Plot the residuals of the task 3 fit against
# time, one colour per temperature, with a line at zero.
#
# - Do you see a pattern, or does it look like noise?
# - Is the scatter about the same width at all three temperatures? Least squares assumed it is.
# - Nobody told you the measurement uncertainty, so `curve_fit` (with
#   `absolute_sigma=False`, the default) estimated it from the scatter of the residuals.
#   Work out that estimate yourself:
#   $s = \sqrt{\sum_i r_i^2 / (N - p)}$, with $N$ data points and $p$ parameters. What does
#   it say about how precisely $C_A$ was measured?
# - Suppose the experimentalist now tells you their instrument is good to ±0.01 mol/L.
#   What would that tell you about your model, or about the experiment?

# ## 5. Your project
#
# One paragraph. Which parameters in your project's model will come from fitting data, and
# where will the data come from: your own simulations, the literature, a research group? What
# can you say about the errors in those data? Are they the same absolute size, the same
# relative size, or known point by point? And are any of your parameters likely to be
# correlated, the way $E_a$ and $A$ are here?

# %% [markdown]
# *Answer:*

# %% [markdown]
# ## Stretch problems (optional)
#
# **(a) Untangle the ridge.** Write $k_f$ in terms of its value at a reference temperature in
# the middle of your data, say $T_\mathrm{ref} = 310$ K:
# $$k_f(T) = k_\mathrm{ref}\exp\left[-\frac{E_a}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_\mathrm{ref}}\right)\right]$$
# It's the same model, written differently. Fit $\log_{10}k_\mathrm{ref}$, $E_a$, $\Delta H$
# and $\Delta S$, and look at the correlation matrix again. What changed, and why? Can you do
# the same for $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$?
#
# **(b) Draw the posterior.** At 298.15 K only, put $k_f$ and $k_r$ on a 2-D grid and draw
# their posterior, as in Lecture 13, part 5, with a flat prior and Gaussian errors of width
# $s$ from task 4. Do its 95% credible intervals (summed over the other parameter) agree with
# `curve_fit`'s 95% confidence intervals? Why should they, or why not?
